# -Switch-Level-verilog
Switch level modelling using verilog.
I have used various MOS logic to model small circuits.
I have used iverilog and gtk wave for compilation and verification.
All files uploaded have been personally verified by me Ajaymalolan.
useful commands for iverilog usage have been included in the dataflow level modelling repository.
