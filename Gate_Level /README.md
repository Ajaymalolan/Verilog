Gate_Level modelling using verilog. I have used basic gate implementations to implement small circuits. I have used iverilog and gtk wave for compilation and verification. All files uploaded have been personally verified by me Ajaymalolan. useful commands for iverilog usage have been included in the dataflow level modelling repository. https://github.com/Ajaymalolan/Data-Flow-modelling-verilog/blob/main/README.md
